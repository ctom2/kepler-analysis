# Data analysis of Kepler-16 system, real-life Tatooine
Replication of data analysis presented by the team responsible for Kepler-16b discovery

## Overview

In this notebook I try to replicate the photometry introduced in paper called Kepler-16: A Transiting Circumbinary Planet using the [Lightkurve](https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve) package for Kepler & TESS time series analysis in Python. The Kepler-16 is a binary system with a discovered planet orbiting the pair of low-mass starts.

The work is based on paper [Kepler-16: A Transiting Circumbinary Planet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.3432.pdf).
